			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>
				<strong>
					Hi! I'm Jeff. I'm just a dude living in San Francisco, CA that likes to make software for good, hike and bike
					<em>everywhere</em>, and teach about what I know and do via public speaking (I won't go into it, but I'm a <a href="http://toastmasters.org" target="_new">Toastmaster</a>).
				</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				The last ten years have been a fun adventure! I lived in the wonderful city of Rochester, NY where I studied Computer Science, Journalism, and Applied Communication at <a href="http://rit.edu" target="_new">RIT</a>. While there, I also first discovered my love of the outdoors, eventually going on to lead the school's Outing Club.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the Rochester chapter of my life closed, I moved to Philadelphia (a super awesome city!). I started off as a software developer at <a href="http://vanguard.com" target="_new">Vanguard</a> and had the opportunity to rotate across many jobs and experience nearly every part of the software developer lifecycle (SDLC): configuration management, user interface development, software testing, research and development, backend development, tool adoption, and training (developer evangelist style). This was part of the Technology Leadership Program, a sort of acceleration into management program.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vanguard was a great place to start and is a wonderful company, but financial services weren't my passion and I set out for something new. I did a quick bounce at <a href="http://medecision.com" target="_new">MEDecision</a> before landing at <a href="http://jnj.com" target="_new">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>'s <a href="http://lifescan.com" target="_new">Lifescan</a> as a Senior Software Developer in Research &amp; Development. I mostly worked on <a href="http://reveal.onetouch.ca" target="_new">OneTouch Reveal</a> (an online diabetes logbook and pattern detector) as a backend Java developer, but also got to lead tech talks, develop prototypes, and visit diabetes clinics in Europe. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As if I didn't geek out enough at work, I have a passion for volunteering my tech skills. After attending a <a href="http://codeforphilly.org" target="_new">Code for Philly</a> event, I wound up volunteering to make a prototype vacant land tracker with the <a href="http://pacdc.org" target="_new">Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations</a>. The prototype came to be known as <a href="http://reclaimphilly.org">Reclaim Philly</a>.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Through Reclaim Philly and some other volunteer projects, I became much more aware of the <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/features/civictech/" target="_new">civic tech</a> community and a non-profit called <a href="http://codeforamerica.org" target="_new">Code for America (CfA)</a> that is at the epicenter of the civic tech movement. <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2014/06/12/jeff-maher-why-im-coding-for-america/" target="_new">Leaping at the opportunity</a> to use my tech skills to improve our most important institutions (government), I applied for and was selected for CfA's one year <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/fellowship/" target="_new">Fellowship program</a> starting in January 2014. Even though I hopped coasts to be in the program in San Francisco, CA; my partner for the year is the State of Rhode Island, where <a href="http://codeforamerica.github.io/ri-2014-mid-year-report/" target="_new">I'm helping to create open source applications for education systems</a>. It's been an incredible experience where I've done everything from user-centered design to community organizing to project management (on top of the obvious coding). 
			</p>
			<p>
				With the CfA Fellowship ending really soon (end of November 2014), I regularly get asked, "what's next?" 
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the last few years, I've really taken a liking to working for mission-driven organizations that use technology make the world a better/happier place (examples: <a href="http://www.jnj.com/sites/default/files/pdf/jnj_ourcredo_english_us_8.5x11_cmyk.pdf" target="_new">J&amp;J has the Credo</a> and <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/about/" target="_new">CfA helps governments created services more in touch with the needs of its community</a>) and would love for my next gig to be at such a government/company/organization. While I love San Francisco and might stay, I'm not cemented here and am open to jobs in other cool cities that are near hiking/biking trails and have lively 20s/30s scenes (such as Denver, Boulder, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, and Washington D.C.).
